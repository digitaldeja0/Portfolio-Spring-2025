    <p>Working at the intersection of design, development, and data, I helped bring dynamic, personalized email journeys to life. From wireframing to final deployment, I was hands-on in creating responsive email templates that looked great across clients â€” while also optimizing performance through A/B testing, segmentation, and data-driven strategy. I thrived in a fast-paced environment where quick iterations were essential. Whether it was fine-tuning mobile responsiveness, adapting to the quirks of different email clients, or adjusting content based on real-time insights, I moved with both speed and intention. Collaboration was key â€” I regularly worked with marketers, copywriters, data teams, and product leads to make sure every message aligned with the brandâ€™s voice and met user needs. The result? Email experiences that werenâ€™t just delivered â€” they connected.</p>
