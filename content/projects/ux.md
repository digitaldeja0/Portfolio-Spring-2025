summary = "I’ve always loved finding ways to improve digital experiences, so I took on a personal project to design a recipe app that would help users discover, organize, and share recipes with ease. I wanted to continue expanding my knowledge and skills, and this project became a perfect opportunity to apply everything I was learning. Over the course of three years, I worked on every aspect of the app’s design, from mapping out user flows to testing various interfaces. I focused on solving real user problems like confusing navigation and difficult search functions, making sure that the final product was both functional and enjoyable to use. In the end, I built a fully interactive site to showcase the app, turning my vision into a tangible tool that people could actually use."
