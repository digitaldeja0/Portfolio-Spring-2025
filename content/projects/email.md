summary = "Working at the intersection of design, development, and data, I helped bring dynamic, personalized email journeys to life. From wireframing to final deployment, I was hands-on in creating responsive email templates that looked great across clients — while also optimizing performance through A/B testing, segmentation, and data-driven strategy. I thrived in a fast-paced environment where quick iterations were essential. Whether it was fine-tuning mobile responsiveness, adapting to the quirks of different email clients, or adjusting content based on real-time insights, I moved with both speed and intention. Collaboration was key — I regularly worked with marketers, copywriters, data teams, and product leads to make sure every message aligned with the brand’s voice and met user needs. The result? Email experiences that weren’t just delivered — they connected."
