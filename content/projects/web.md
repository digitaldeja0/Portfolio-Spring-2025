summary = "During a fast-paced game jam, I took on the role of web developer to design and launch a fun, engaging website that captured the spirit of our 2.5D game. The goal was to create a branded online presence that would attract organic interest and grow a fan base even before the game was complete. I focused on building a playful, responsive landing page that showcased key visuals, trailers, and updates while staying true to the game's tone. The site helped generate early excitement, boosted traffic, and gave our project a polished edge during and after the jam. Beyond the web, I also contributed to early game developmentâ€”specifically mapping and level design. I worked with the team to source and organize 3D assets, and helped design the layout and flow for the first two stages of the game. This included creating initial map structures, defining player paths, and integrating assets in a way that supported both visual storytelling and gameplay. My work helped establish the foundation for the game's world and ensured consistency between the digital presence and the in-game experience."
