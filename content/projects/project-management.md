summary = "I co-led the creation of a one-day event that blended networking, dance, and photography into a dynamic, hands-on experience centered around human connection. This wasn’t just another mixer — it was a collaborative effort to design an atmosphere where people could engage in energizing ways, beyond small talk. Working closely with artists, facilitators, and community members, I helped shape the flow of the event, coordinate logistics, and map out an experience that felt intentional from start to finish. My focus was on service design — making sure every touchpoint, from the environment to the activities, supported meaningful interaction. The result was a space that felt playful, welcoming, and deeply human — where attendees walked away not only with new contacts, but with real shared moments."
