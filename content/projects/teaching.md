summary = "As a technical educator, I created and hosted live content on Twitch and YouTube to make design and development more approachable for beginners and self-taught learners. Through livestreamed workshops, hands-on tutorials, and community discussions, I helped demystify concepts across UI/UX, web development, and game design. My goal was to make learning feel collaborative and fun â€” not overwhelming. I structured each session around real-world challenges, encouraging viewers to ask questions, follow along, and build with confidence. Whether it was teaching HTML fundamentals or walking through the logic of a game mechanic, I focused on clarity, encouragement, and momentum. Over time, the content helped foster a small but growing community of curious, creative learners."
